The worldwide\nmarketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors\nmany different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and\nomnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to\nconsumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and\nall distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online\nand app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other\nretailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales,\ninventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that\nprovide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that\nprovide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services;\n(7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8)\ncompanies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether\nin digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and\nconvenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include\nthe quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business\npractices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand\nrecognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers,\nadopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to\ntheir own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology,\ninfrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances\nthe ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid\nchange and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also\nmay enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\nIntellectual Property\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary\ntechnologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law,\ntrade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to\nprotect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain\nnames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications\ncovering certain of our proprietary technology.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter,\nwhich ends December 31.\nHuman Capital\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2022, we\nemployed approximately 1,541,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and\ntemporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software\nengineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for\npersonnel across other parts of our business.\nAs we strive to be Earth's best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and\nengagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and\ninvent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills\ntraining and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon\nTechnical Academy (software development engineer training). Over 100,000 Amazon employees around the world have\nparticipated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and\nretain our employees to promote equity for all candidates and employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at\nAmazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety\ncontrols, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex\nproblems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and\nhave deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.\n4\nfrom\n", "page_tables": []}, {"page": 1, "page_text": "Board of Directors\nName\nJeffrey P.

Weeks\nItem 1A.\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an\ninvestment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may\nor may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth,\nreputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows,\nliquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by\nfactors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant\nrisks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview,\" and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical\nconditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks\ndiscussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could\nindirectly have a material adverse effect on us.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nWe Face Intense Competition\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies,\nincluding cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-\ncommerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and\ntransportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories,\nmore customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer\ngeographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to\ntechnology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and\nwell-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in\nother market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including\nsearch, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition.\nThe Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known\nbusinesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may\nfail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could\nmaterially reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or\nservice offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if\ncustomers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or\nquality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be\nsuccessful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure\nto realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those\ninvestments being written down or written off.

In\ncertain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-\nmarket advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and\npromote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of\nrisks, including:\nlocal economic and political conditions;\ngovernment regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive\ngovernmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and\ntariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\nrestrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products,\nservices, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal\nprecedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media\nproducts and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\nbusiness licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\nlimited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\nshorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\nlaws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security,\nconsumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\nlower levels of use of the Internet;\nlower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\nlower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural\ndifferences;\ndifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting\ncorrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\nlaws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\ngeopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\nAs international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will\nintensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive\nadvantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local\nbrand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.\nThe People's Republic of China (\"PRC\") and India regulate Amazon's and its affiliates' businesses and operations in\ncountry through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT\ninfrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products\nand services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide\ncertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide\nservices. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online\nmulti-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-\nparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are\nthird-party sellers on the www.amazon. in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing\nlaws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in\ntheir regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial\nuncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will\n7\n", "page_tables": []}, {"page": 3,

"Competition\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide\nmarketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from\nmany different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and\nomnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to\nconsumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and\nall distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online\nand app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other\nretailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales,\ninventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that\nprovide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that\nprovide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services;\n(7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8)\ncompanies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether\nin digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and\nconvenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include\nthe quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and willingness to change business\npractices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand\nrecognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers,\nadopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to\ntheir own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology,\ninfrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances\nthe ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid\nchange and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also\nmay enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\nIntellectual Property\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary\ntechnologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law,\ntrade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to\nprotect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain\nnames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications\ncovering certain of our proprietary technology.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter,\nwhich ends December 31.\nHuman Capital\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2021, we\nemployed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and\ntemporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software\nengineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for\npersonnel across other parts of our business.\nAs we strive to be Earth's best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and\nengagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and\ninvent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills\ntraining and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon\nTechnical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our\nemployees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.\n4\n", "page_tables": []}, {"page": 1, "page_text": "Risk Factors\nItem 1A.\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an\ninvestment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may\nor may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth,\nreputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows,\nliquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by\nfactors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant\nrisks to our operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business\nand operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations,\" and in the risk factors below, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen circumstances,\ndevelopments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nWe Face Intense Competition\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies,\nincluding cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-\ncommerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and\ntransportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories,\nmore customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer\ngeographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to\ntechnology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and\nwell-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in\nother market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including\nsearch, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition.\nThe Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known\nbusinesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may\nfail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could\nmaterially reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or\nservice offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if\ncustomers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in\nour newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup\nour investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could\nresult in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be\nunsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do\nnot successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In\ncertain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-\nmarket advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and\npromote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of\nrisks, including:\nlocal economic and political conditions;\ngovernment regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive\ngovernmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and\ntariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\nrestrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products,\nservices, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal\n6\n", "page_tables": []}, {"page": 2, "page_text": "precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media\nproducts and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\nbusiness licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\nlimited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\nshorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\nlaws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer\nprotection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\nlower levels of use of the Internet;\nlower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\nlower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural\ndifferences;\ndifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting\ncorrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\nlaws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\ngeopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\nAs international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will\nintensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive\nadvantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local\nbrand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.\nThe People's Republic of China (\"PRC\") and India regulate Amazon's and its affiliates' businesses and operations in\ncountry through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT\ninfrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products\nand services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide\ncertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide\nservices. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online\nmulti-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-\nparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are\nthird-party sellers on the www.amazon. marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing\nlaws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes\ntheir regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial\nuncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will\nultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to\ncontinue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships\nwe or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the\ninterpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other\nfinancial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.\nThe Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality,\npromotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to natural or human-caused disasters (including\npublic health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we\nexpect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular\nproducts in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future\ngrowth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur\ncommitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due\nto complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the\nholiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may\nexperience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may\nreduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable\n7\nin\n", "page_tables": []}, {"page": 3, "page_text": "to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other\nfulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere\nin this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.\nWe generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect\nproceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash\nequivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided\nby or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as\nof December 31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a\ncorresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.\nWe Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have\nin the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we\nmaintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers\nnever receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers' descriptions,\nand to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling\ngoods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When\nthese policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation\nand we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse\nbuyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will\nincrease and could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing\nIntellectual Property Rights of Third Parties\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and\nsimilar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret\nprotection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary\nrights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made\navailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business.\nFurthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be\nunable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our\ntrademarks and other proprietary rights.\nWe are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions\ntaken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or\nreputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nMoreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third\nparties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently\ndevelop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged\ninfringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past,\nand may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or\nsignificant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who\nallege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks\nhave been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital\ncontent. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and\ncontent providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\nWe Have Foreign Exchange Risk\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and\nproduct and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may\ndiffer materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany\nbalances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also\nhold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and\n8\n", "page_tables": []}, {"page": 4, "page_text": "CASH, CASH
